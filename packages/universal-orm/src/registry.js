// The runtime adapter registry — the seam that makes the 3-package split pay off
// (#66, part of #44). Rom's design: "the app installs one adapter and hands it the
// connection; extensions stay ORM-free." The app calls `setAdapter(...)` ONCE at
// server start with its chosen backend — `@universal-orm/memory` for dev/test, or
// `@universal-orm/drizzle` for real — and every extension reads the SAME adapter via
// `getAdapter()` and builds its repository over its own schema. One app-owned
// connection serves them all; no extension imports an ORM.
//
// Cached on `globalThis` so duplicate module evaluation (pointer imports, dev HMR)
// can't fork the registry into two adapters.
import { ADAPTER_OPS } from './repository.js'

// contract `createRepository` enforces, so a malformed adapter fails here — at the
// app's call site — with a clear message, not later inside an extension.
